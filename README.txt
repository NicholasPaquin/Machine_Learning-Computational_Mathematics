This is by Nicholas Paquin, a student at the university of waterloo in ECE, this is a library I have built in order to establish a strong foundation in computational mathmatics and machine learning.
I hope you enjoy.
More documentations and functions to come:
-Auto differentiation
-Machine learning based classes
-Automated gradient descent
etc...
